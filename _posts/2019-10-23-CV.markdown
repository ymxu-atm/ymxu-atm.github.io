2015/07—2019/01: The tropical and extratropical-origin summer meridional teleconnections over East Asia
Research Advisor: Prof. Xuguang Sun
* Analyze the structure and the interannual variability of the teleconnection in observation.
* The associated time series are used to understand the source and the influence on circulation and precipitation.

2019/01—Present: Characteristics of Summer Regional persistent extreme precipitation events and their typical atmospheric circulation patterns over Eastern China
Research Advisor: Prof. Xuguang Sun
* Classify the regional extreme precipitation events via k-mean cluster analysis and look for related atmospheric circulation patterns and energy source.
* Try to use the circulation pattern to predict the extreme events and evaluate the models’ skill in prediction.
